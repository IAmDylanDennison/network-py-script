# network-py-script
A script I created to help the Network Admins at Avita health systems log and cofig cisco network switches.
Used the python pip library netmiko. The library provides functionality to log into switches. User must input credentials to log into each switch. 
Modifcation be made to have user input credentials for every device IP. 
Very cool!
